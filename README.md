# Electric-shocker-via-web
This is the repository for the electric shocker control via web application.

# Description

Ever wondered what happens when web development, electronics, and a little bit of mischief collide? In this workshop, we’ll build a login website powered by an ESP32 microcontroller — but with a twist. Enter the wrong password too many times, and your ESP32 will trigger a safe electric shocker to “remind” you to remember your password next time.

# You’ll learn how to:

Set up and program an ESP32 using Arduino IDE

Design a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript login page served directly from the board

Use C++ logic to handle user input, password attempts, and device control

Connect a shock module and safely integrate it with your hardware

This workshop is all about hands-on learning and having fun while exploring the intersection of IoT, web development, and embedded systems. No prior experience is needed — just curiosity and a sense of adventure!

# What We’ll Do

Step-by-step setup of ESP32 environment

Build and host your own login page

Write the code that connects web logic to hardware control

Assemble your own circuit using breadboard and a shock module

Test and demo your final project

By the end, you’ll walk away with your very own interactive IoT device and a better understanding of how hardware and web technologies can work together.

# What to prepare

Laptop with Arduino IDE and Visual Studio Code installed

ESP32 board, breadboard, jumper wires, and battery

Enthusiasm, creativity, and maybe… a brave friend to test your invention.
